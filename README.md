# Tensorflow Examples

This repository contains a few examples of simple neural networks created with TensorFlow.  It is primarily intended for use with the introductory Machine Learning presentation at Centric Cincinnati Technology Days.  However, it may be that others may find this useful as well.

Please do not judge my (very rusty) Python too harshly.
